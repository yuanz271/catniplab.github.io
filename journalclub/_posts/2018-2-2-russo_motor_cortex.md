* Abstract

Primate motor cortex projects to spinal interneurons
and motoneurons, suggesting that motor cortex activity
may be dominated by muscle-like commands.
Observations during reaching lend support to this
view, but evidence remains ambiguous and much
debated. To provide a different perspective, we employed
a novel behavioral paradigm that facilitates
comparison between time-evolving neural and muscle
activity. We found that single motor cortex neurons
displayed many muscle-like properties, but the
structure of population activity was not muscle-like.
Unlike muscle activity, neural activity was structured
to avoid ‘‘tangling’’: moments where similar activity
patterns led to dissimilar future patterns. Avoidance
of tangling was present across tasks and species.
Network models revealed a potential reason for this
consistent feature: low tangling confers noise robustness.
Finally, we were able to predict motor cortex
activity from muscle activity by leveraging the hypothesis
that muscle-like commands are embedded
in additional structure that yields low tangling.
