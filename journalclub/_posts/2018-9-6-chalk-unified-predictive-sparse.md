* Abstract

A central goal in theoretical neuroscience is to predict the
response properties of sensory neurons from first principles. To
this end, “efficient coding” posits that sensory neurons encode
maximal information about their inputs given internal constraints.
There exist, however, many variants of efficient coding
(e.g., redundancy reduction, different formulations of predictive
coding, robust coding, sparse coding, etc.), differing in
their regimes of applicability, in the relevance of signals to be
encoded, and in the choice of constraints. It is unclear how these
types of efficient coding relate or what is expected when different
coding objectives are combined. Here we present a unified
framework that encompasses previously proposed efficient coding
models and extends to unique regimes. We show that optimizing
neural responses to encode predictive information can lead
them to either correlate or decorrelate their inputs, depending on
the stimulus statistics; in contrast, at low noise, efficiently encoding
the past always predicts decorrelation. Later, we investigate
coding of naturalistic movies and show that qualitatively different
types of visual motion tuning and levels of response sparsity
are predicted, depending on whether the objective is to recover
the past or predict the future. Our approach promises a way to
explain the observed diversity of sensory neural responses, as due
to multiple functional goals and constraints fulfilled by different
cell types and/or circuits.
