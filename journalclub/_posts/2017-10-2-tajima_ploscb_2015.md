* Abstract

Advances in recording technologies have enabled the acquisition of neuronal dynamics data at unprecedented scale and resolution, but the increase in data complexity challenges reductionist model-based approaches. Motivated by generic theorems of dynamical systems, we characterize model-free, nonlinear embedding relationships for wide-field electrophysiological data from behaving monkeys. This approach reveals a universality of inter-areal interactions and complexity in conscious brain dynamics, demonstrating its wide application to deciphering complex neuronal systems.
