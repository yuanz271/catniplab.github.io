#### Abstract
It is not clear how, after a large perturbation, the brain explores
the vast space of potential neuronal activity states to recover
those compatible with consciousness. Here, we analyze recovery
from pharmacologically induced coma to show that neuronal
activity en route to consciousness is confined to a low-dimensional
subspace. In this subspace, neuronal activity forms discrete metastable
states persistent on the scale of minutes. The network of
transitions that links these metastable states is structured such
that some states form hubs that connect groups of otherwise
disconnected states. Although many paths through the network
are possible, to ultimately enter the activity state compatible with
consciousness, the brain must first pass through these hubs in an
orderly fashion. This organization of metastable states, along with
dramatic dimensionality reduction, significantly simplifies the task
of sampling the parameter space to recover the state consistent
with wakefulness on a physiologically relevant timescale.
